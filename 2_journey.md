Sure! Here's a step-by-step implementation plan for creating a Python script that generates an orientation checklist and a report of missing steps, including a console UI with ASCII art:

### Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

#### Step 1: Define the Checklist
- **Objective**: Create a checklist for the orientation process.
- **Action**: Define the checklist items in a JSON format.
- **Code**:
    ```python
    checklist = {
        "Orientation Process": [
            "Complete HR paperwork",
            "Set up work email",
            "Set up workstation",
            "Attend orientation meeting",
            "Meet with team members",
            "Review company policies",
            "Complete mandatory training",
            "Set up direct deposit",
            "Get access to necessary software",
            "Tour the office"
        ]
    }
    ```

#### Step 2: Save the Checklist to a JSON File
- **Objective**: Store the checklist in a JSON file for persistence.
- **Action**: Use the `json` module to write the checklist to a file.
- **Code**:
    ```python
    with open('orientation_checklist.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump(checklist, f, indent=4)
    ```

#### Step 3: Create a Function to Generate the Report
- **Objective**: Identify and report the missing steps based on completed steps.
- **Action**: Write a function that compares completed steps with the checklist and generates a report.
- **Code**:
    ```python
    def generate_report(completed_steps):
        missing_steps = [step for step in checklist["Orientation Process"] if step not in completed_steps]
        report = {
            "Completed Steps": completed_steps,
            "Missing Steps": missing_steps
        }
        return report
    ```

#### Step 4: Implement the Console UI
- **Objective**: Create an interactive console interface for users to input completed steps.
- **Action**: Write a main function that handles user input and displays the report.
- **Code**:
    ```python
    def main():
        print_ascii_art()
        print("Welcome to the Orientation Checklist Console UI!")
        print("Please enter the steps you have completed, one by one.")
        print("Type 'done' when you are finished.\n")

        completed_steps = []
        while True:
            step = input("Enter a completed step (or 'done' to finish): ")
            if step.lower() == 'done':
                break
            completed_steps.append(step)

        report = generate_report(completed_steps)

        with open('orientation_report.json', 'w') as f:
            json.dump(report, f, indent=4)

        print("\nChecklist and report have been generated and saved to 'orientation_checklist.json' and 'orientation_report.json' respectively.")
        print("Completed Steps:", report["Completed Steps"])
        print("Missing Steps:", report["Missing Steps"])
    ```

#### Step 5: Add ASCII Art for the Console UI
- **Objective**: Enhance the console UI with ASCII art for a better user experience.
- **Action**: Define a function to print ASCII art.
- **Code**:
    ```python
    def print_ascii_art():
        print(r"""
      ____             _             _   _             
     / __ \  ___  _ __| |_  ___  ___| |_(_) ___  _ __  
    / / _` |/ _ \| '__| __|/ _ \/ __| __| |/ _ \| '_ \ 
    | (_| | (_) | |  | |_|  __/ (__| |_| | (_) | | | |
     \__, |\___/|_|   \__|\___|\___|\__|_|\___/|_| |_|
     |___/                                             
        """)
    ```

#### Step 6: Run the Main Function
- **Objective**: Execute the main function to start the console UI.
- **Action**: Add a conditional to run the main function if the script is executed directly.
- **Code**:
    ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

### Final Script
Combine all the steps into a single script:

```python
import json

# Define the checklist in JSON format
checklist = {
    "Orientation Process": [
        "Complete HR paperwork",
        "Set up work email",
        "Set up workstation",
        "Attend orientation meeting",
        "Meet with team members",
        "Review company policies",
        "Complete mandatory training",
        "Set up direct deposit",
        "Get access to necessary software",
        "Tour the office"
    ]
}

# Save the checklist to a JSON file
with open('orientation_checklist.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(checklist, f, indent=4)

# Function to generate a report of missing steps
def generate_report(completed_steps):
    missing_steps = [step for step in checklist["Orientation Process"] if step not in completed_steps]
    report = {
        "Completed Steps": completed_steps,
        "Missing Steps": missing_steps
    }
    return report

# ASCII art for the console UI
def print_ascii_art():
    print(r"""
  ____             _             _   _             
 / __ \  ___  _ __| |_  ___  ___| |_(_) ___  _ __  
/ / _` |/ _ \| '__| __|/ _ \/ __| __| |/ _ \| '_ \ 
| (_| | (_) | |  | |_|  __/ (__| |_| | (_) | | | |
 \__, |\___/|_|   \__|\___|\___|\__|_|\___/|_| |_|
 |___/                                             
    """)

# Main function to run the console UI
def main():
    print_ascii_art()
    print("Welcome to the Orientation Checklist Console UI!")
    print("Please enter the steps you have completed, one by one.")
    print("Type 'done' when you are finished.\n")

    completed_steps = []
    while True:
        step = input("Enter a completed step (or 'done' to finish): ")
        if step.lower() == 'done':
            break
        completed_steps.append(step)

    report = generate_report(completed_steps)

    # Save the report to a JSON file
    with open('orientation_report.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump(report, f, indent=4)

    print("\nChecklist and report have been generated and saved to 'orientation_checklist.json' and 'orientation_report.json' respectively.")
    print("Completed Steps:", report["Completed Steps"])
    print("Missing Steps:", report["Missing Steps"])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
