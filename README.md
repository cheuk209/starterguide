Sure! Here's the updated table with the "Journey" section included:

| Section         | Description                                                                                                      | Action                |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **üåç Real**         | *The Job That Starts with Objective and Key Results* - Sets goals and objectives, aligning tasks with measurable results. | Aim > Goals   |
| **üöÄ Journey**      | *Journey Completed* - Chronicles the progress and milestones achieved throughout the project.                         |  Track > Milestones  |
| **üå≥ Environments** | *The Roadmap and Use Cases* - A roadmap with learning modules and real-world use cases to apply new skills.            | Create > Runtimes |
| **üåå Imaginary**    | *What You Learn on the Road* - Tracks concepts, theories, and skills acquired, promoting continuous growth.            | Capture > Screenshots |
| **üìê Formulas**     | *The Guides That Are Mentioned* - Essential guides and formulas for understanding and solving project challenges.     |  GPT > Learn from it |
| **üî£ Symbols**      | *Code That Is Implemented* - Includes code snippets and examples to demonstrate each concept practically.              |  Execute > Code   |
| **üåÄ Semblance**    | *Errors Found in the Process* - Documents mistakes and solutions, making errors valuable learning opportunities.       |  Fix > Errors   |

This structure should help you organize your project effectively, ensuring that each aspect is well-documented and easily accessible. If you need further customization or have any other questions, feel free to ask!

Using a hierarchical numbering system for your project files and documentation can help keep everything organized and easy to navigate. Here's a general guideline on how to structure and use these numbers:

### Hierarchical Numbering System

1. **Major Sections (1, 2, 3, etc.)**: These represent the main sections of your project.
   - Example: `1. Real`, `2. Environments`, `3. Imaginary`, etc.

2. **Subsections (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.)**: These represent the primary subdivisions within each major section.
   - Example: `1.1 Objectives`, `1.2 Key Results`, etc.

3. **Sub-subsections (1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3, etc.)**: These represent further subdivisions within each subsection.
   - Example: `1.1.1 Goal Setting`, `1.1.2 Progress Tracking`, etc.

4. **Files and Documents (1.1.1.0, 1.1.1.1, etc.)**: These represent individual files or documents within each sub-subsection.
   - Example: `1.1.1.0 README.md`, `1.1.1.1 goals.md`, etc.

### When to Use Each Level

- **1.1.0**: Use this for the main document or file that introduces or summarizes the subsection.
  - Example: `1.1.0 README.md` for an overview of the `Objectives` subsection.

- **1.1.1**: Use this for specific topics or components within the subsection.
  - Example: `1.1.1 Goal Setting`, `1.1.2 Progress Tracking`.

- **1.1.1.0**: Use this for the main document or file within a specific topic.
  - Example: `1.1.1.0 README.md` for an overview of `Goal Setting`.

- **1.1.1.1**: Use this for additional files or documents related to the specific topic.
  - Example: `1.1.1.1 goals.md`, `1.1.1.2 milestones.md`.



PromptFixer:
-act as a prompt engineer,review the prompt and ask your questions,write a better version of the prompt
- Also for each section I'd like to have subsection like real is 1. So all files under real will be 1.1.0 etc... When do I use 1.1.1 or 1.2 ?
