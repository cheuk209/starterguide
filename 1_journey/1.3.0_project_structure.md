### Basic Checklist Program for DevOps Engineer

Here's a basic checklist program for a DevOps engineer using Python:

```python
import json

# Define the checklist
checklist = {
    "Setup Environment": [
        "Install Python",
        "Install Docker",
        "Setup Virtual Environment"
    ],
    "Code Quality": [
        "Run Linter",
        "Run Unit Tests",
        "Check Code Coverage"
    ],
    "CI/CD Pipeline": [
        "Setup Jenkins",
        "Configure Build Jobs",
        "Setup Deployment Pipeline"
    ],
    "Monitoring": [
        "Setup Prometheus",
        "Configure Grafana Dashboards",
        "Setup Alerting"
    ]
}

def display_checklist(checklist):
    for category, tasks in checklist.items():
        print(f"\n{category}:")
        for task in tasks:
            print(f"  - {task}")

def main():
    print("DevOps Engineer Checklist")
    display_checklist(checklist)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script defines a basic checklist for a DevOps engineer and displays it. You can expand this script to include more detailed tasks and categories as needed. If you have any specific requirements or need further customization, feel free to let me know!
