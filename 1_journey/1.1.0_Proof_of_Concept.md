# 🚀 User Journey Tracker: Proof of Concept

## 📋 Overview
This document outlines the key objectives and expected results for creating a simple Python program designed to track a user's journey through a series of steps. The goal is to provide a clear and concise explanation of the project without delving into the actual code implementation.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. **Define the User Journey**: Identify the steps a user will go through in the journey.
2. **Track Progress**: Implement a mechanism to track which steps the user has completed.
3. **Store Data**: Decide on a method to store the user's progress (e.g., in-memory, file, database).
4. **User Interface**: Design a simple interface for users to interact with the program.
5. **Feedback Mechanism**: Provide feedback to the user on their progress and next steps.

## 📝 Key Results
- **Step Identification**: A clear list of steps that make up the user journey.
- **Progress Tracking**: A system that accurately tracks and updates the user's progress.
- **Data Storage**: A reliable method for storing and retrieving user progress data.
- **User Interface**: An intuitive interface that allows users to easily navigate through the steps.
- **User Feedback**: Real-time feedback on the user's progress and guidance on upcoming steps.

## 📅 Phases of Development

### Phase 1: Terminal-Based Prototype
- **Objective**: Create a basic prototype that runs the user through a series of questions in the terminal.
- **Expected Outcome**: A functional terminal-based program that can ask questions and record user responses.

### Phase 2: Stateful Tracking
- **Objective**: Enhance the program to track the user's progress through various stages and remember their completed steps.
- **Expected Outcome**: A stateful program that can save and retrieve user progress, allowing users to resume their journey from where they left off.

### Phase 3: Chatbot Integration
- **Objective**: Export the program to a chatbot interface, enabling users to interact with it on Microsoft Teams.
- **Expected Outcome**: A chatbot that can guide users through the journey, track their progress, and provide feedback within Microsoft Teams.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: The primary programming language for the project.
- **SQLite**: For data storage (optional, depending on complexity).
- **Tkinter**: For creating a simple graphical user interface (optional).
- **Microsoft Bot Framework**: For integrating the program into Microsoft Teams.

## 📈 Expected Outcomes
By the end of this project, we expect to have a functional Python program that can:
- Track a user's journey through predefined steps.
- Store and retrieve user progress data.
- Provide an intuitive interface for user interaction.
- Offer real-time feedback on user progress.

## 🤝 Collaboration
We welcome feedback and suggestions to improve the project. Feel free to reach out with any ideas or questions!

Thank you for your interest in the User Journey Tracker project! Let's make tracking progress a seamless experience for users. 🚀

Prompts:
- create a proof of concept md file complete with emojis: About wanting to create a simple Python Program to track a user's journey through a bunch of steps that we define. 
    Do not output code. this is just for explanation and establishing key objectives and results
- I expect there to be different phases. The first prototype will have the feature to only be able to run the user through a bunch of questions on the terminal. The second iteration will become stateful so it is able to track the user through various stages and remembers what they done. The third phase will be to export this program to a chatbot so users can query it on Microsoft Teams. Please update the docs accordingly.
