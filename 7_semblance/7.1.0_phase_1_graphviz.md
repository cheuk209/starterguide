graphviz.backend.execute.ExecutableNotFound: failed to execute PosixPath('dot'), make sure the Graphviz executables are on your systems' PATH
```

## üîç Error Analysis
The error indicates that the `dot` executable from Graphviz is not found in your system's PATH. This is causing the `graphviz` library to fail when trying to render the flowchart.

### Key Points:
- **FileNotFoundError**: The system cannot find the `dot` executable.
- **ExecutableNotFound**: The `graphviz` library raises this error when it cannot execute the `dot` command.

## üõ†Ô∏è Possible Solutions
1. **Install Graphviz**: Ensure that Graphviz is installed on your system.
   - **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install graphviz`
   - **MacOS**: `brew install graphviz`
   - **Windows**: Download and install from the Graphviz website.

2. **Add Graphviz to PATH**: Make sure the Graphviz `bin` directory is added to your system's PATH.
   - **Linux/MacOS**: Add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:
     ```sh
     export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin/graphviz
     ```
   - **Windows**: Add the Graphviz `bin` directory to the PATH environment variable.

3. **Verify Installation**: Check if the `dot` command is available in your terminal.
   ```sh
   dot -V
   ```
   This should display the version of Graphviz if installed correctly.

## üìã Example Commands
### Linux/MacOS
```sh
sudo apt-get install graphviz
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin/graphviz
dot -V
```

### Windows
1. Download and install Graphviz from the Graphviz website.
2. Add the Graphviz `bin` directory to the PATH environment variable.
3. Open Command Prompt and run:
   ```sh
   dot -V
   ```

## üéâ Conclusion
By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `ExecutableNotFound` error and successfully render your flowchart using the `graphviz` library. If you encounter any further issues, feel free to reach out for more assistance! üòä
