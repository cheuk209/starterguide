Sure! Here's a Python script that takes in a JSON file representing a workflow and asks the user sequentially whether they have completed each step. 

First, let's create a JSON structure that includes the timeframes and steps. (`workflow.json`) looks something like this:
Sure! Here's a JSON structure that includes the timeframes and steps you described, with some dummy fields populated under "Before ERA Access" and "First Time Visit" for the "Month 1" timeframe.
## First iteration
### JSON Structure (`workflow.json`):
```json
{
    "timeframes": {
        "Month 1": {
            "Before ERA Access": [
                "Step 1: Complete initial registration",
                "Step 2: Attend orientation session",
                "Step 3: Submit required documents"
            ],
            "First Time Visit": [
                "Step 1: Schedule first visit",
                "Step 2: Meet with advisor",
                "Step 3: Tour the facility"
            ]
        },
        "3 Months In": {
            "Follow-Up": [
                "Step 1: Complete first progress report",
                "Step 2: Attend follow-up meeting",
                "Step 3: Review goals and milestones"
            ]
        },
        "6 Months In": {
            "Mid-Year Review": [
                "Step 1: Submit mid-year report",
                "Step 2: Attend mid-year review meeting",
                "Step 3: Adjust goals as needed"
            ]
        },
        "12 Months In": {
            "Annual Review": [
                "Step 1: Complete annual report",
                "Step 2: Attend annual review meeting",
                "Step 3: Plan for the next year"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Timeframes**: The main categories representing different periods (e.g., "Month 1", "3 Months In", "6 Months In", "12 Months In").
- **Steps within Timeframes**: Each timeframe contains specific steps that need to be completed. For "Month 1", there are two sub-categories ("Before ERA Access" and "First Time Visit"), each with its own set of steps.

You can add more sub-categories and steps as needed by following this structure. Let me know if you need any further adjustments or additional information! üòä


Sure! Here's a Python script that takes the provided JSON structure and asks the user questions in the terminal. The script includes some nice ASCII art and playful questions to make the interaction more engaging.

### Python Script:
```python
import json

def load_workflow(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)

def ask_user_about_steps(timeframe, steps):
    print(f"\nTimeframe: {timeframe}")
    for step in steps:
        response = input(f"üåü Have you completed '{step}'? (yes/no): ").strip().lower()
        if response != 'yes':
            print(f"üöß Please complete '{step}' before proceeding. üöß")
            return False
    return True

def main():
    # ASCII Art Header
    print(r"""
     _    _      _                            _         
    | |  | |    | |                          | |        
    | |  | | ___| | ___ ___  _ __ ___   ___  | |_ ___   
    | |/\| |/ _ \ |/ __/ _ \| '_ ` _ \ / _ \ | __/ _ \  
    \  /\  /  __/ | (_| (_) | | | | | |  __/ | || (_) | 
     \/  \/ \___|_|\___\___/|_| |_| |_|\___|  \__\___/  
                                                      
    """)

    workflow = load_workflow('workflow.json')
    timeframes = workflow.get('timeframes', {})
    if not timeframes:
        print("No timeframes found in the workflow.")
        return
    
    for timeframe, steps_dict in timeframes.items():
        print(f"\nüöÄ Starting Timeframe: {timeframe} üöÄ")
        for sub_timeframe, steps in steps_dict.items():
            print(f"\nüìÖ Sub-Timeframe: {sub_timeframe}")
            if not ask_user_about_steps(sub_timeframe, steps):
                break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### How It Works:
1. **Load Workflow**: The `load_workflow` function reads the JSON file and loads the timeframes and their respective steps.
2. **Ask User About Steps**: The `ask_user_about_steps` function iterates through each step within a timeframe and asks the user if they have completed it. If any step is not completed, it stops and prompts the user to complete it before proceeding.
3. **Main Function**: The `main` function orchestrates the loading of the workflow and sequentially asks the user about each timeframe and its steps.

### Running the Script:
1. Save the JSON content to a file named `workflow.json`.
2. Save the Python script to a file, for example, `user_journey_tracker.py`.
3. Run the script using the command: `python user_journey_tracker.py`.

This script will ensure that the user completes all steps within a timeframe before moving on to the next one, with playful prompts and ASCII art to enhance the user experience. Let me know if you need any further modifications or assistance! üòä

## Include additional info at each step
To include extra information and HTML URLs for each step, you can modify the JSON structure to include an optional "info" field for each step. The Python script can then display this information when the user requests it.

## Allow traversal
Let's enhance it to allow users to move forward and backward through the questions, and add some cool ASCII animations for transitions.

Prompts:
- Let's begin with Phase 1 then, Create for me a python script that will take in a JSON file (which represents a workflow) that when we run, would ask the user sequentially whether the user has completed the step.
- I actually expect there to be different timeframes. And that each timeframe contains steps, and you have to complete a time frame before moving onto another one. <br><br>For example:<br>Month 1 <br>3 months <br>6 months<br>12 Months<br><br>But also allow me the chance to configure more sub-timeframes with each
- Let's define the JSON structure first, <br><br>I want it to look like this<br>Timeframe - month 1, 3 months in, 6 months in, 12 months in<br>But then within month 1, there may be several steps, like "before ERA access", "First Time Visit". Populate some dummy fields under Before Era Access and First time visits for me to add 
- right this is the JSON structure I am working with. Can you now create a python script that will take it and ask the user questions when run in the terminal. PLease complete with nice ASCII Art and make the questions playful
- Right at each step, I wish to include extra information that is optional for the people to read, including html urls that they can click on to access the relevant resource. How may I do that?
- Hello really happy with the python script so far, can you please allow the additional functionality to traverse back and forth the questions, like moving forward and backwards? Allow cool ASCII animation when you move
